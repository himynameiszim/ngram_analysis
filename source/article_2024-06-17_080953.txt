## Lecture Notes

Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable resources do not run out over time, making them sustainable for long-term use. There are several forms of renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energies. Each type has its own technology and methodology for harnessing power from nature's elements.

For instance, the **Rankine cycle** is a thermodynamic process commonly used in power stations that convert heat into work. It involves heating water to create steam which then drives turbines connected to generators to produce electricity. This cycle can be adapted for use with renewable energy sources such as geothermal or concentrated solar power systems, where the earth's natural heat or the sun's rays provide the necessary temperatures.

The **Brayton cycle** is another thermodynamic cycle primarily used in gas turbine engines, which are found in jet aircraft and some power plants. In renewable energy applications, this cycle can be utilized in concentrated solar power systems where mirrors focus sunlight to heat a fluid that then generates steam for electricity production.

**Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC)** is an intriguing concept that leverages the temperature difference between warmer surface water and colder deep seawater to generate electricity, typically in tropical regions where this temperature gradient exists year-round. It's a form of ocean renewable energy with great potential but currently limited by technological challenges and high costs.

**Wave power** is harnessed from the surface waves or pressure fluctuations below the water level. Various devices can be employed to capture this energy, such as floating buoys that move with the waves. This form of renewable energy is less developed than others like wind and solar but has significant untapped potential due to the vast energy present in ocean waves globally.
