The Keepers of Echoes serve a critical role in preserving these sacred texts.

Other gateways lead to various planes of existence: one to the Dreaming Expanse - a plane dominated by sentient manifestations of thoughts and emotions, another to the Crystalline Dominion ruled by beings composed entirely of pristine crystal structures.

Furthermore, they collaborate with interdimensional scholars to document discoveries made during otherworldly excursions and share insights beneficial to all realms involved.

Guardian Training (Sentences 31-40)
Aspiring Luminants undergo rigorous training in the Guardians' Sanctum, a secluded area within Virelia where students develop their innate abilities through mentorship and practical application of ancient knowledge. The curriculum is divided into several stages:
